# Machine Learning in Python

This repository contains some assignments and exercises of Machine Learning course of Sebastian Thrun and Katie Malone.

Please read the license file. I do **NOT** take any responsibility in case of plagiarism. It's **ONLY** educational purpose.

## Exercises:
### 001:

Decide whether car should go fast or slow depending on bumpiness level of road.

* Plot data with decision line by using Naive Bayes, and save it in 'test.png'
* Calculate accuracy (sklearn build-in)

### 002:

* Same thing in exercises 01 is done again however, this time with SVM and linear kernel.

## Mini-Projects:

Before try to run any of the assignments, please run 'startup.py' in 'tools' directory. This will automatically install e-mail data set and extract it (which is about 423 MB in tgz, 1.4 GB when decompressed).

### Lesson 1: Naive Bayes

* Naive Bayes Classifier is used to identify emails by their authors. 
* Also time performance and accuracy are calculated.

### Lesson 2: SVM

In this mini-project, weâ€™ll tackle the exact same email author ID problem as the Naive Bayes mini-project, but now with an SVM. What we find will help clarify some of the practical differences between the two algorithms. This project also gives us a chance to play around with parameters a lot more than Naive Bayes did, so we will do that too.
