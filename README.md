## Exercises:
### 001:

Decide whether car should go fast or slow depending on bumpiness level of road.

* Plot data with decision line by using Naive Bayes, and save it in 'test.png'
* Calculate accuracy (sklearn build-in)

## Project:

Before try to run any of the assignments, please run 'startup.py' in 'tools' directory. This will automatically install e-mail data set and extract it (which is about 423 MB in tgz, 1.4 GB when decompressed).

### Lesson 1: Naive Bayes
